By default, this workflow goes prepackaged if a file named RectangleConfig.json on workflow`s home folder containing default shortcuts for Rectangle.

If you use custom shortcuts you can:
- Export your Rectangle configs as a JSON an replace the file RectangleConfig.json on the home folder of this workfow
- Save it elsewere and edit the variable RECT_CONFIG_FILE passing the **absolute path** to your custom config file.

>The workflow will automatically map the settings on your config file.
